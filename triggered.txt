because the files within node_modules should not be uploaded into git, within the node_modules directory 
place the file '.gitignore' with contents

*
!.gitignore

(i.e. asterisk * followed by !.gitignore)

git commands
to upload files into git
git add .                          (every file that has changed/new except within node_modules which has .gitignore)
git add file.html                  (a specific file)
git commit -m "a descriptive term" 
git push                           (pushes up into git)

IF a error is made (like forgetting .gitnore in node_modules)
to undo commits (before uploading)
do
git reset            (basiclly starting from scratch, )
